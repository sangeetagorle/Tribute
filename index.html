            Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
            administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
            efforts.He thus came to be known as The Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
            and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

            cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral
            ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.</p>
